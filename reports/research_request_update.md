Update note for omriki-2011 (User ID: omriki-2011).

No specific research topic has been provided yet. Awaiting topic clarification from user. If desired, starter questions or broad topic areas can be proposed to kick off the research process.

Starter questions (optional):
- What is your primary goal for this research? (overview vs. deep dive, practical outcome, timeline)
- Do you prefer a broad survey of potential topics or a focused examination of a particular area?
- Are there constraints on depth, sources, or citation style (APA, MLA, etc.)?
- Are there preferred domains for sources (academic, industry reports, news, case studies)?
- Would you like me to propose 3–5 starter topics to choose from within your field of interest?

If you want starter topics now, I can present a few broad areas and tailor them once you provide a domain or context.
